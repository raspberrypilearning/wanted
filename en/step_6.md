## Styling headings

Let's improve the style of the `<h1>` heading.

Add the following code underneath your image's CSS:

 ```
 h1 {

 }
 ```

 This is where you'll add CSS properties for your main `<h1>` heading.

To change the font of your `<h1>` headings, add the following code between the curly brackets:

 ```
 font-family: Impact;
 ```

--- /task ---

You can also change the size of the heading:

 ```
 font-size: 50pt;
 ```

--- /task ---

 Have you noticed that there's a big space between the `<h1>` heading and the stuff around it?

 This is because there's a margin around the heading. A margin is the space between the element (in this case a heading) and the other stuff around it.

 You can make the margin smaller with this code:

 ```
 margin: 10px;
 ```

 ```
