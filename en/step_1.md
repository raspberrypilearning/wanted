## Introduction:
In this project, children will have an opportunity to write their own CSS. They will also edit and write CSS properties and selectors to make their own poster.

## Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Wanted' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-wanted](http://jumpto.cc/web-wanted)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Wanted' Finished -- trinket.io/html/ebeb56398a](https://trinket.io/html/ebeb56398a)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/webdev-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ template/index.html
+ template/style.css
+ wanted/index.html

+ wanted/robot.png

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)
